Following consultation public health agency expert World Health Organization publishes global technical consultation report introducing updated terminology pathogen transmit air pathogen covered include cause respiratory infection e.g COVID-19 influenza measles Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS tuberculosis among others.The publication entitled “ Global technical consultation report proposed terminology pathogen transmit air ” result extensive multi-year collaborative effort reflects shared agreement terminology expert four major public health agency Africa Centres Disease Control Prevention Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention European Centre Disease Prevention Control United States Centers Disease Control Prevention agreement underline collective commitment public health agency move forward together matter wide-ranging consultation conducted multiple step 2021-2023 addressed lack common terminology describe transmission pathogen air across scientific discipline challenge became particularly evident COVID-19 pandemic expert various sector required provide scientific policy guidance Varying terminology highlighted gap common understanding contributed challenge public communication effort curb transmission pathogen “ Together diverse range leading public health agency expert across multiple discipline pleased able address complex timely issue reach consensus ” said Dr Jeremy Farrar Chief Scientist “ agreed terminology pathogen transmit air help set new path research agenda implementation public health intervention identify communicate respond existing new pathogens. ” extensive consultation resulted introduction following common descriptor characterize transmission pathogen air typical circumstance Individuals infected respiratory pathogen generate expel infectious particle containing pathogen mouth nose breathing talking singing spitting coughing sneezing particle described term ‘ infectious respiratory particle ’ IRPs.IRPs exist continuous spectrum size single cut point applied distinguish smaller larger particle facilitates moving away dichotomy previously used term ‘ aerosol ’ generally smaller particle ‘ droplet ’ generally larger particle .The descriptor ‘ air ’ used general way characterize infectious disease main mode transmission involves pathogen travelling air suspended air umbrella ‘ air transmission ’ two descriptor used 1 Airborne transmission inhalation case IRPs expelled air inhaled another person Airborne transmission inhalation occur short long distance infectious person distance depends various factor airflow humidity temperature ventilation etc IRPs theoretically enter body point along human respiratory tract preferred site entry may pathogen-specific.2 Direct deposition case IRPs expelled air infectious person directly deposited exposed mouth nose eye another person nearby entering human respiratory system potentially causing infection “ global technical consultation process concerted effort many influential experienced expert ” said Dr Gagandeep Kang Christian Medical College Vellore India Co-Chair Technical Working Group “ Reaching consensus terminology bringing stakeholder unprecedented way small feat Completing consultation give u new opportunity starting point move forward better understanding agreed principle disease transmit air ” added Dr Yuguo Li University Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR China also co-chaired Technical Working Group.This consultation first phase global scientific discussion led Next step include technical multidisciplinary research exploration wider implementation implication updated descriptor
