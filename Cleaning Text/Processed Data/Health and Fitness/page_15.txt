major new study released Lancet Neurology show 2021 3 billion people worldwide living neurological condition World Health Organization contributed analysis Global Burden Disease Injuries Risk Factor Study GBD 2021 data Neurological condition leading cause ill health disability worldwide overall amount disability illness premature death known disability-adjusted life year DALYs caused neurological condition increased 18 since 1990.Over 80 neurological death health loss occur low- middle-income country access treatment varies widely high-income country 70 time neurological professional per 100 000 people low- middle-income country “ Neurological condition cause great suffering individual family affect rob community economy human capital ” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Director-General “ study serve urgent call action scale targeted intervention allow growing number people living neurological condition access quality care treatment rehabilitation need important ever ensure brain health better understood valued protected early childhood later life. ” top ten neurological condition contributing loss health 2021 stroke neonatal encephalopathy brain injury migraine dementia diabetic neuropathy nerve damage meningitis epilepsy neurological complication preterm birth autism spectrum disorder nervous system cancer Overall neurological condition cause disability health loss men compared woman condition like migraine dementia woman disproportionately affected.Since 1990 absolute number individual living dying neurological condition increased age-standardized DALY rate dropped mean increase absolute number mainly driven demographic change people living longer Diabetic neuropathy fastest growing neurological condition number people diabetic neuropathy tripled globally since 1990 rising 206 million case 2021 increase line worldwide increase diabetes condition neurological complication COVID-19 example cognitive impairment Guillain-Barré syndrome previously exist account 23 million cases.At time neurological burden health loss due condition decreased 25 since 1990 result improved prevention including vaccine care research tetanus rabies meningitis neural tube defect stroke neurocysticercosis parasitic infection affect central nervous system encephalitis inflammation brain neonatal encephalopathy brain injury study also examined 20 modifiable risk factor potentially preventable neurological condition stroke dementia idiopathic intellectual disability Eliminating key risk factor – importantly high systolic blood pressure ambient household air pollution – could prevent 84 stroke DALYs Similarly preventing exposure lead could reduce burden idiopathic intellectual disability 63.1 reducing high fasting plasma glucose level could reduce burden dementia 14.6 Smoking significantly contributed stroke dementia multiple sclerosis risk.More investment needed improve treatment care quality lifeAt World Health Assembly 2022 Member States adopted Intersectoral global action plan epilepsy neurological disorder 2022–2031 IGAP ambitious scope address long standing neglect neurological disorder “ Intersectoral Global Action Plan 2022–2031 set roadmap country improve prevention early identification treatment rehabilitation neurological disorder achieve equity access quality care also need invest research risk brain health improved support healthcare workforce adequate service ” said Dévora Kestel Director Department Mental Health Substance Use.IGAP set strategic objective target improve access treatment care support people neurological disorder implement strategy brain health promotion disease prevention strengthen research data emphasize public health approach epilepsy neurological disorder
