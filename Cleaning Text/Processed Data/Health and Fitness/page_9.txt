combination inaccessibility insecurity high concentration zero dose under-immunized child population displacement factor evident northern Yemen northern Nigeria south central Somalia eastern DR Congo also northern Mozambique Burkina Faso Mali South Sudan Sudan.ConclusionThe Committee unanimously agreed risk international spread poliovirus still remains Public Health Emergency International Concern PHEIC recommended extension Temporary Recommendations three month Committee considered following factor reaching conclusion Ongoing risk WPV1 international spread Based following factor risk international spread WPV1 remains re-infection epidemiologically critical area historical reservoir like Karachi Quetta Block Pakistan Kandahar Afghanistan represents significant risk gain made last 18 month actual spread WPV1 lineage seen predominantly Afghanistan 2022 detected Pakistan 2023 2024 high-risk mobile population Pakistan represent specific risk international spread Afghanistan particular compounded large number returnees Pakistan number province Afghanistan large pool unvaccinated ‘ zero dose ’ underimmunized child southern Afghanistan constitutes major risk area Afghanistan still allow site site mosque mosque immunization response shown le effective house house modality although likely transmission WPV1 interrupted Malawi Mozambique route Pakistan Africa remains unknown pocket insecurity remaining endemic transmission zone andany setback Afghanistan pose risk programme Pakistan due high population movement.Ongoing risk cVDPV international spread Based following factor risk international spread cVDPV2 appears remain high outbreak cVDPV1 ongoing high transmission cVDPV2 eastern Democratic Republic Congo cVDPV2 north-western Nigeria caused international spread neighboring country ongoing cross border spread including newly re-infected country Angola Liberia Senegal Sierra Leone new emergence cVDPV2 South Sudan whole genome sequencing WGS indicates origin virus novel OPV2 despite vaccine never used country However South Sudan share many land border country used novel OPV2 year 2022 – 2023 including Ethiopia Kenya Uganda DR Congo CAR ever-widening gap population intestinal mucosal immunity young child since withdrawal OPV2 2016 consequently high concentration zero dose child certain area andinsecurity area source cVDPV transmission.Contributing factor include Weak routine immunization Many country weak immunization system impacted humanitarian emergency including conflict protracted complex emergency pose growing risk leaving population fragile state vulnerable polio outbreak Lack access Inaccessibility continues major risk particularly northern Yemen Somalia sizable population unreached polio vaccine extended period year.Risk categoriesThe Committee provided Director-General following advice aimed reducing risk international spread WPV1 cVDPVs based risk stratification follows States infected WPV1 cVDPV1 cVDPV3.States infected cVDPV2 without evidence local transmission.States previously infected WPV1 cVDPV within last 24 months.Criteria ass States longer infected WPV1 cVDPV Poliovirus Case 12 month onset date recent case PLUS one month account case detection investigation laboratory testing reporting period reported AFP case onset within 12 month last case tested polio excluded WPV1 cVDPV environmental sample collected within 12 month last case also tested negative whichever longer.Environmental isolation WPV1 cVDPV poliovirus case 12 month collection recent positive environmental sample healthy child PLUS one month account laboratory testing reporting period.These criterion may varied endemic country rigorous assessment needed reference surveillance gaps.Once country meet

epidemiological block Afghanistan Pakistan case number cVDPV1 cVDPV2 continue decrease globally example Madagascar following intensive vaccine response appears halted transmission since September 2023 demonstrated environmental surveillance international spread continues emphasizing need strengthen cross border collaboration area polio eradication surveillance data sharing synchronization case response immunization round border vaccination posts.The Committee recognizes concern regarding lengthy duration polio PHEIC importance exploring alternative measure committee noted current review International Health Regulations taking place amendment Regulations possible 2024 Committee felt still early discontinue PHEIC risk exportation WPV cVDPVs remains significant removal PHEIC may send wrong message critical juncture polio eradication.The committee appreciates commitment Afghan authority global goal polio eradication note appreciates increased use woman health care worker campaign strongly encourages house house campaign implemented wherever feasible campaign enhance identification coverage zero dose under-immunized child committee concerned pause testing reporting polio test result January February 2024 led large backlog specimen heightened risk undetected transmission late detection outbreak Given historically high standard achieved surveillance sensitivity timeliness detection avoiding recurrence essential ensure timely identification assessment risk inform continued effective vaccination response Afghanistan committee urge country ensure polio detection outbreak response timely possible.The committee noted environmental surveillance played significant role detection new outbreak detected several country Angola Liberia Sierra Leone encouraged country continue work improve quality ES maximize benefit implementation.The committee concerned hear ongoing supply issue regarding novel OPV2 noted plan obtain second supplier committee considered securing vaccine supply critical issue planning ensure robust vaccine supply beyond admission new supplier encouraging country declare public health emergency following detection new outbreak crucial action need supported GPEI ensuring vaccine availability.Many cVDPV infected country remain conflict affected disrupting routine immunization Nevertheless step taken increase coverage second dose IPV prevent child crippled Front line worker need protected harm course duty interplay insecurity poor polio vaccine coverage risk cVDPV clear.Based current situation regarding WPV1 cVDPVs report provided
