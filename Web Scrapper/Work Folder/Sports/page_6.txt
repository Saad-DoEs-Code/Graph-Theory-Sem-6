West Indies Women on Thursday defeated Pakistan Women in the opening ODI by 113 runs after West Indies captain Hailey Matthews scored a career-best 140 not out — her fifth career century in 81 matches — for her side, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a press release.
The visitors won the toss and elected to bat first at the National Stadium Karachi.
 
 

Matthews, who collected the player of the match award, opened the innings for her side alongside Rashada Williams, who departed early after she was caught and bowled by Sadia Iqbal. Matthews then put on 102 runs for the second wicket with Shemaine Campbelle.
After the West Indies slipped from 103 for one to 138 for four, Matthews added 40 runs for the fifth wicket with Chinelle Henry, the press release said, adding that it was her brilliance that allowed the West Indies to collect 77 runs in the last 10 overs.
The 26-year-old from Barbados struck 15 fours and a six in a 150-ball innings to guide her side to 269 for eight, the press release said.
Matthews then demonstrated her skills with the ball to cap a fine day in the office by grabbing three wickets for 17 runs in six overs as the home team was bowled out for 156 in 35.5 overs, it said,
Matthews’s century came from 125 balls with nine fours and a six. She had earlier reached her half-century from 57 balls with six fours and a six.
The home side were left chasing the game from the very start when they plummeted to 65 for four, which soon became 100 for six before getting eventually dismissed for 156, the press release said.
It added that opener Muneeba Ali and Nida Dar had offered some resistance against all the “accurate West Indies bowlers”.
“Apart from Matthews, Afy Fisher and Zaida James picked up two wickets apiece, conceding 14 and 19 runs, respectively,” it said.
The second ODI between the sides in a three-match series will be played on April 21 at the same venue.
