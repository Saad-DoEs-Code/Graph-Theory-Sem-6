LAHORE:  While Lahore and Karachi recorded facile wins against Peshawar and Multan respectively, Quetta edged past Rawalpindi on the first day of the National Women’s One-day Tournament at different venues in Faisalabad on Wednesday.
Ayesha Zafar’s unbeaten century failed to avert a seven-wicket defeat for Peshawar at the hands of Lahore at the Bohranwali Cricket Ground.
Chasing a modest 167, Lahore comfortably achieved their target in 31 overs for the loss of only three wickets, with Dua Majid scoring 66 not out of 74 balls with the help of six fours while captain Kaynat Hafeez contributed a 69-ball 61 laced with eight fours.
Earlier, Ayesha made a 94-ball 108 studded with 16 fours and two sixes but lacked support from the other end as Peshawar totalled a modest 166 all out in 32.5 overs.
Ayesha Bilal (four for 33), Anam Amin (three for 30) and Noreen Yaqoob (two for 40) were among the wickets for Lahore.
At the Iqbal Stadium, Karachi defeated Multan by six wickets.
Pursuing a scanty 117, Karachi raced to victory for the loss of four wickets in just 23.1 overs as Omaima Sohail top-scored with 49.
Batting first, Multan had been dismissed for 116 in 36.3 overs. 
Rameen Shamim’s all-round performance helped Quetta beat Rawalpindi by two wickets in a low-scoring affair at the Jawad Sports Complex Ground.
She first took four wickets for 16 runs to help his team bundle out Rawalpindi for 80 in 43 overs and then scored a 76-ball 27 not out to enable before Quetta to achieve a narrow victory with more than 13 overs to spare.
